Emulation and Operation Monitoring (EOM) Tool.
==============================================

This package enables an operator to assess the operational impact of
RPKI validation on routing behavior without actually enabling validation
on their AS border routers. The tool accomplishes this by interfacing
with one or more instances of an RPKI-RTR server instance and comparing
the validated prefix information against RIB information collected from
one or more routers. RIB information can be collected from routers using
either Trigger or RANCID, depending on the environment that the operator
already has in place to manage router configuration control.

Note that even though most interfaces in the map_resources module are
marked as public, they are still in flux and subject to change.
