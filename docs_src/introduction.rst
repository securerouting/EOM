EOM  - An Emulation and Operations Monitoring Tool
==================================================

The purpose of this tool is to provide an emulation environment in which
an ISP (or other BGP AS) can analyze the impact of planned deployment of
RPKI validation in local conditions, without impacting their routing
operations. 

In the current version the tool simply enables the operator to assess if
best route selection changes when validation is enabled.
In the future the EOM Tool could assist the operator in
scenarios such as the following (note that these features are
implemented yet).

* Assessing the manner in which the best path changes when different localpref/weight settings are used.
* Combining data from multiple routers in different ASNs to check for any routing-level inconsistencies.
* Assessing potential problems associated with validating prefixes in a multihoming environment.
* Assessing whether an ISPâ€™s reliance on multiple rpki-rtr manager instances could result in routing-level inconsistencies.
* Testing custom prefix assignment and certification conditions for simulation of failures and other special scenarios - e.g. resource transfers.

High-level overview
-------------------

The block diagram above highlights the different sub-components within
the EOM tool. At a high level the EOM tool fetches RPKI information
from one or more RPKI caches, polls RIB related information from routers,
analyzes the different pieces of data retrived from these data
sources against various parameters, and display its results through some
front-end.

The following sub-sections describe the functionality associated with
each EOM tool sub-component.

rpki-rtr-cli
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This component provides the client interface to the rpki-rtr
protocol.  It builds upon the existing rpki-rtr
implementation from rpki.net but instead of communicating with a router
this module interfaces with an aggregator module that maintains a
local store of validated RPKI information.

The rpki-rtr-cli module can communicate with multiple rpki-rtr manager
instances in order to be able to mimic cases where an ISP relies on
multiple rpki-rtr manager instances for serving validated RPKI
information to its various ASBR routers.

rtr-status-fetcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module is responsible for fetching various pieces of status
information from a router, including its routing table and next hop
neighbors. The data is fetched using the Trigger module which queries
each configured router for its 'sh ip bgp' output.

Note that the event loop structure in Trigger is  incompatible with the
rpki-rtr module. This issue may have to be revisited in later releases
of the EOM software in order to make the data fetch operations from the
two modules more compatible.

The rtr-status-fetcher module saves all fetched data into a local store
through the aggregator module. 

aggregator
~~~~~~~~~~

This module is responsible for storing and retrieving validated
rpki route objects associated with various rpki-rtr manager instances
and router status information for the different routers queried.

EOM-engine
~~~~~~~~~~

The EOM-Engine module provides the central functionality for enabling a
network operator to configure and develop various types of operational
scenarios and router policies to study the impact of RPKI validation on
their network operations. 

This module is still under development, but is expected to interface
with the UI module to gather user input on the types of analyses that
are to be performed. It will access previously saved router and RPKI
cache data through the aggregator module and prepare the data for
subsequent analysis by other modules.

In order to build scenarios that include misconfigured or particular
forms of RPKI validation data, the EOM engine will also interface with a
private RPKI store that will allow the user to build test ROAs on the
fly to simulate various prefix assignment and certification conditions.

analyzer
~~~~~~~~

This module performs the analysis over the different streams of data
that are made available to it.  The primary function of this module is
to detect and flag differences in the routing state. It stores the
results of its processing in persistent storage through the aggregator
module.

reporter
~~~~~~~~

The reporter takes the raw results generated by the
analyzer module and transforms that data to a form that is useful for
user consumption. The output format is currently simple text, but it
could be changed to other more useful formats as needed.

UI
~~

The User Interface module provides the engine for displaying the
various pieces of EOM data. In the future, this module will also provide
the configuration interface for the users, to enable them to specify the
location and parameters associated with the different routers and RPKI
stores, and to enable them to define the parameters associated with
their different scenarios of interest.
